# EEE443 - Neural Networks

This repository contains coursework, including assignments, projects, and tutorials from the Neural Networks (EEE443) course at Bilkent University. 

## Final Project

- **Project Name:** Text-to-Image Synthesis using Conditional Latent Spaces and Generative Adversarial Networks

  _Abstract_: Our project develops a deep learning model that turns textual descriptions into matching visual representations. Our model architecture combines Conditional Latent Spaces (CLSs) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), producing images directly from textual descriptions. An iterative refinement method is also applied to incrementally enhance the quality of the synthetic images. For further information and access to the trained model, please refer to the provided [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z-IR_WorbH6grMTZ_Zi2MUNRDrveD3pQ/view?usp=sharing).

## Mini Projects

- **Autoencoder Neural Network:** Implementing an autoencoder neural network for unsupervised feature extraction from natural images.

- **Natural Language Processing:** Constructing a neural network architecture for examining sequences of words with an aim to predict the fourth word in sequence given the preceding trigram.

- **Recurrent Neural Network Architectures:** Classifying human activity from movement signals measured with three sensors simultaneously using different recurrent neural network architectures such as a single layer RNN, LSTM, and GRU.
